All notable changes to Kingdom of Agents.

## [0.1.0] - Initial release

- Standalone extraction of the Kingdom of Agents dashboard from [Agent Arcade](https://github.com/DanWahlin/agent-arcade).
- Decorated, resizable Tauri 2 window (not an overlay) with persistent size/position.
- Single Phaser 4 scene rendering districts, ops panel, replay timeline, and session inspector.
- Rust `AgentProvider` trait with `CopilotProvider` impl that scans `~/.copilot/session-state/`,
  allowlists fields, and emits push updates via a debounced `notify = 8` filesystem watcher.
- Curated CC0 Tiny Swords asset subset in `assets/kingdom/tiny-swords/`.
- 19 Playwright tests covering scene behavior and a six-viewport layout regression.
